# Old-Scripts
A Collection of old scripts I wrote and decided to upload.

Most, if not all, scripts in this repo are written in PowerShell.
It was my first initial "language" and one that I was most comfortable writing in initially.

Most are massive messes of code tossed together in a single file. Maybe someday I'll circle back and actually structure it properly and improve up them.

I uploaded these scripts to remind myself of my initial projects and skill level as a reminder of how far I've come.
For some of these scripts, I have fond memories of writing and using them.
