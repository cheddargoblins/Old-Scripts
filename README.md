# Old-Scripts
I've decided to upload a selection of **old** scripts written by me. The ones presented here are ones that I felt were personally noteworthy of my initial ability, ingenuity, and project types. These are also the ones I was able to upload.

Most, if not all, scripts in this repo are written in PowerShell. It was my first "language" and one that I was most comfortable writing in initially.

Most of these scripts are (massive) messes of code tossed together within a single file. Maybe someday I'll circle back and actually structure these scripts properly and improve them.

I uploaded these scripts showcasing my initial projects and skill level as a reminder of how far I've come. For some of these scripts, I have fond memories of writing and using them.


## Scripts Purposes
- Spidey: Remote Computer Forensics
- Hash Search and Destroy: File hasher that will delete a specified file based on its hash from a remote computer
- NoWhiteSpace: Removes all multiple whitespace characters from a file
- OVA Convertor: Script for converting multiple, specified VMs into OVAs. Also gives the option to save completed OVAs to an external hard drive and power off the computer once all tasks are completed. Requires VMware's OVF Tool.
